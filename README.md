The insurance industry relies on vast datasets to assess risk and offer personalized policies. With the growing availability of data and advances in computing power, insurers can now tailor policies more precisely to individual clients. However, the use of extensive data raises concerns about fairness. We tackle the challenge of ensuring fairness without compromising performance. 

We propose a novel method, Cond-2WB, to pre-process datasets to fairness. Cond-2WB leverages 2-Wasserstein barycenters inference to \textit{repair} datasets by removing sensitive information, while retaining predictive power. Cond-2WB is a scalable and unsupervised model that uses \textit{convex neural architectures} \cite{amos2017inputconvexneuralnetworks} to learn optimal mappings to the barycenter of a set of empirical distributions.

We demonstrate the model's ability to ensure fairness while maintaining predictive power by performing tests and benchmarks both on synthetic data \cite{korotin2021neuraloptimaltransportsolvers} and real-world datasets \cite{chzhen2020fair, gouic2020projection}. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees on the method's effectiveness and explore the trade-offs involved in fairness-aware insurance modeling.
